        Hello! I am K'Lyn Thomas (pronounced 'Kay-LYNN'). 
        <br>
        <br>I grew up in Preston and Rexburg, Idaho and moved around those two areas nearly every year. 
        I loved it and still love change and meeting new people. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My husband Curtis and I have been married for over 21 years. 
        We have lived in Utah, Arizona, and Idaho so far. 
        We now live just south of Grace, Idaho in a beautiful country setting with our 9 children (well, 8 since our oldest is serving a mission in the Dominican Republic). 
        We have hosted 5 exchange daughters thus far. They have come from Thailand, Hong Kong, Netherlands, and Spain. 
        We love each of them and the variety it provides. Hosting helps us to continue progressing and becoming.
      </p>
      <p>I love being a wife and mom. I love being with my family doing most anything even cleaning and projects!
        Reunions are a joy to me - immediate and extended. 
        <br>
        <br>Learning and The Gospel of Jesus Christ are dear to my heart. 
        I love to make connections and help people connect to their dreams.  
        The gratitude I feel in having the Restoration, The Book of Mormon, Temple Ordinances & Covenants, and Living Prophets & Apostles. 
        <br>
        <br>My hope is to use the deeper understanding gained throughout my life via study and experience to be a better disciple and missionary wherever I may be.
