        Hello! I am K'Lyn Thomas (pronounced 'Kay-LYNN'). 
        <br>
        <br>I grew up in Preston and Rexburg, Idaho and moved around those two areas nearly every year. 
        <br>I loved it and still love change and meeting new people. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <br>My husband Curtis and I have been married for over 21 years. 
        <br>We have lived in Utah, Arizona, and Idaho so far. 
        <br>We now live just south of Grace, Idaho in a beautiful country setting with our 9 children (well, 8 since our oldest is serving a mission in the Dominican Republic). 
        <br>We have hosted 5 exchange daughters thus far. They have come from Thailand, Hong Kong, Netherlands, and Spain. 
        <br>We love each of them and the variety it provides. Hosting helps us to continue progressing and becoming.
      </p>
      <p>I love being a wife and mom. I love being with my family doing most anything even cleaning and projects!
        <br>Reunions are a joy to me - immediate and extended. 
        <br>
        <br>Learning and The Gospel of Jesus Christ are dear to my heart. 
        <br>I love to make connections and help people connect to their dreams.  
        <br>The gratitude I feel in having the Restoration, The Book of Mormon, Temple Ordinances & Covenants, and Living Prophets & Apostles. 
        <br>
        <br>My hope is to use the deeper understanding gained throughout my life via study and experience to be a better disciple and missionary wherever I may be.
